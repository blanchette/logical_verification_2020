/- ## Question 1 (4 points): Connectives and Quantifiers

1.1 (3 points). Complete the following proofs using basic tactics such as
`intro`, `apply`, and `exact`.

Hint: Some strategies for carrying out such proofs are described at the end of
Section 2.3 in the Hitchhiker's Guide. -/

lemma B (a b c : Prop) :
  (a → b) → (c → a) → c → b :=
sorry

lemma S (a b c : Prop) :
  (a → b → c) → (a → b) → a → c :=
sorry

lemma more_nonsense (a b c : Prop) :
  (c → (a → b) → a) → c → b → a :=
sorry

lemma even_more_nonsense (a b c : Prop) :
  (a → a → b) → (b → c) → a → b → c :=
sorry

/- 1.2 (1 point). Prove the following lemma using basic tactics. -/

lemma weak_peirce (a b : Prop) :
  ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
sorry


/- ## Question 2 (5 points): Logical Connectives

2.1 (1 point). Prove the following property about implication using basic
tactics.

Hints:

* Keep in mind that `¬ a` is the same as `a → false`. You can start by invoking
  `rw not_def` if this helps you.

* You will need to apply the elimination rules for `∨` and `false` at some
  point. -/

lemma about_implication (a b : Prop) :
  ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
sorry

/- 2.2 (2 points). Prove the missing link in our chain of classical axiom
implications.

Hints:

* You can use `rw double_negation` to unfold the definition of
  `double_negation`, and similarly for the other definitions.

* You will need to apply the double negation hypothesis for `a ∨ ¬ a`. You will
  also need the left and right introduction rules for `∨` at some point. -/

#check peirce
#check double_negation

lemma em_of_dn :
  double_negation → excluded_middle :=
sorry

/- 2.3 (2 points). We have proved three of the six possible implications
between `excluded_middle`, `peirce`, and `double_negation`. State and prove the
three missing implications, exploiting the three theorems we already have. -/
